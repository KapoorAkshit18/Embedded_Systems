## 🧠 I. Introduction to Microcontrollers and Microprocessors

| Feature | Microprocessor (uP) | Microcontroller (uC) |
|------|-----------------|------------------|
| Storage | Requires external memory | Internal storage included |
| Role | Acts as "master controller" | Acts as "slave controller" |
| Example | Raspberry Pi | ATmega328P (Arduino Uno) |

> **Note:** Arduino boards like the Uno use microcontrollers with built-in memory, making them compact and ideal for embedded systems.
